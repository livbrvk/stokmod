Projects done in the course stochastic modelling, fall 2020.

In total, the project-portion of the course was comprised of four disjunct tasks. Two of the tasks were regarding the outbreak of infectious diseases with Markov chains.
One task was regarding the modeling of insurance claims. The remaining task was to calibrate a climate model according to a conditional mean and variance.
All the coding in this repository was done by me.
